# Deleting a type

To delete a type, proceed as follows:

::: {.note .note-prerequisite .with-title}
**Prerequisite**

You must be the "administrator" of the workspace.
:::

1.  Open the workspace in which the type that you would like to delete
    is defined.

2.  Click **Workspace settings** in the workspace navigation menu and
    then click the menu item **Types** in the context menu that is now
    displayed.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The table with the types of this workspace
    is displayed.

3.  In the table search for the type that you would like to delete.

4.  Click the name of the type.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The type definition page is opened. All
    the pages of this type are displayed in a table.

5.  In the page navigation bar, click the "More" button .

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The drop-down menu is opened.

6.  Click the **Delete** option.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The "Confirm deletion" dialog is
    displayed.

    ::: {.note .note-hint .with-title}
    **By deleting a type, you also delete all attributes and pages of
    this type**

    If you have deleted a type by mistake, you can restore it using the
    "Deleted Elements" page in the user menu.\
    To restore the attributes and pages of a type, first you have to
    restore the type itself. Then you can restore the attributes and
    pages of the type. You can only do this individually, however.
    :::

    ::: {.note .note-hint .with-title}
    **Delete types that originate from apps or app definition workspaces
    (ADA)**

    A type added by installing an app cannot be deleted as long as the
    corresponding app is installed in the workspace.\
    You must first uninstall the app before you can delete the type.
    :::

7.  Enter the word "DELETE" in the input field.

8.  Click the **\[Delete\]** button to confirm the deletion of the type.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The deletion of the type is started in a
    separate batch job.

9.  After the deletion process has finished, click the **\[OK\]** button
    to close the dialog.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The type overview of the workspace is
    displayed.
