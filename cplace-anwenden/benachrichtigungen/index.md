# Notifications

You can easily share pages with other users in cplace by means of
notifications. You will find shared pages and messages in the
notifications bar (Notifications). The bar also contains notifications
of the completion of (long-running) batch jobs that you have started.

::: {.note .note-prerequisite .with-title}
**Prerequisite**

Notifications must be activated in the application settings for the
notification icon to be visible in the header and for the "Notify user"
function to be visible on pages. This adjustment can only be made by
administrators of the instance/tenant.
:::

## Sending a notification

See ["Sharing and watching
pages".](/user-manual-en/cplace-anwenden/seiten/seiten-teilen-und-beobachten/)

## Receiving notifications / opening the notifications bar {#receiving-notifications--opening-the-notifications-bar}

The notification icon in the header informs you of new / unread
notifications.

1.  In the header click the "Notification" button to show the bar with
    the notifications.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The bar with the notifications is
    displayed. You will see all notifications, sorted from new to old.

2.  Click a notification to open the shared page or the completed batch
    job.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The page or the batch job is opened. The
    notification is automatically marked as read.

## Marking a notification as read

To mark a notification as read, proceed as follows:

1.  Beside a notification, click .

    ::: md__image
    [](../../graphics/cplace-anwenden/Benachrichtigung-gelesen-de.png)
    ![\"\"](../../graphics/cplace-anwenden/Benachrichtigung-gelesen-de.png){loading="lazy"
    aria-label="Enlarged version of the current image"}
    :::

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The notification is still displayed in the
    notifications, but is no longer highlighted and is no longer counted
    in the total of unread notifications in the icon in the header.

## Deleting a notification

To delete a notification, proceed as follows:

1.  Click the trash can icon next to the notification.

    ::: md__image
    [](../../graphics/cplace-anwenden/Benachrichtigung-loeschen-de.png)
    ![\"\"](../../graphics/cplace-anwenden/Benachrichtigung-loeschen-de.png){loading="lazy"
    aria-label="Enlarged version of the current image"}
    :::

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The notification is deleted.

## Mark as read or delete all non-critical notifications

To mark all non-critical notifications as read or delete them at once,
proceed as follows:

::: {.note .note-info .with-title}
**Non-critical notifications**

Non-critical notifications are all notifications that have been sent
manually by users through the "Notify user" link and notifications about
successfully completed batch jobs that you have started. Note that for
example also changing permissions results in a batch job for which you
will receive a notification after it has been completed. Notifications
about failed batch jobs are critical.
:::

*Mark all as read:*

1.  Click the checkmark icon next to "All uncritical" above the
    notifications.

    ::: md__image
    [](../../graphics/cplace-anwenden/Benachrichtigung-alle-unkritischen-gelesen-de.png)
    ![\"\"](../../graphics/cplace-anwenden/Benachrichtigung-alle-unkritischen-gelesen-de.png){loading="lazy"
    aria-label="Enlarged version of the current image"}
    :::

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} All non-critical notifications are marked
    as read.

*Delete:*

1.  Click the trash can icon next to "All uncritical" above the
    notifications.

    ::: md__image
    [](../../graphics/cplace-anwenden/Benachrichtigung-alle-unkritischen-loeschen-de.png)
    ![\"\"](../../graphics/cplace-anwenden/Benachrichtigung-alle-unkritischen-loeschen-de.png){loading="lazy"
    aria-label="Enlarged version of the current image"}
    :::

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} All non-critical notifications are
    deleted.
