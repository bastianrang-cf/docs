# Tables

In cplace, you can output almost all data in tables. The "Table" widget
provides various functions for searching, filtering and sorting the
content displayed. In addition, it is possible to change cell contents
using copy and paste within the table, which allows you to edit
attributes of several pages very quickly with just a few entries without
having to open each page individually.

## Sorting the table

The content of each table can be sorted by attributes. The default
setting is sorting by name in ascending order. There are several options
for setting up an alternative form of sorting:

### Changing primary table sorting

1.  Click the column header of the attribute that you want to sort by.

[]{.fas .fa-check-square} The table is sorted according to the selected
attribute.

### Adding secondary table sorting

1.  If you want to add further sorting in addition to the primary
    sorting of the table, click the "Toggle sorting" button next to the
    desired attribute in the column header.

[]{.fas .fa-check-square} Secondary sorting has been activated. Table
entries not differentiated in the primary sorting are now additionally
sorted based on the attribute you have selected.

You can add as many additional sortings as you like.

### Adjusting the table sorting

As soon as the sorting of a table deviates from the default, the
**\[Sorting activated\]** button is displayed at the lower end of the
table. To adjust the sorting, proceed as follows:

1.  Click the **\[Sorting activated\]** button.

[]{.fas .fa-check-square} The "Column sorting" dialog is displayed.

2.  Adjust the sorting in the "Column sorting" dialog as required.

3.  Click the **\[Apply\]** button.

[]{.fas .fa-check-square} The sorting you have set is applied to the
table.

The following functions are available to you in the "Column sorting"
dialog:

#### Add sorting

1.  Under "Displayed columns", click the attribute that you want to add
    to the active sorting.

    from the sorting, click the "Withdraw" button .

sorting.

#### Restore defaults
