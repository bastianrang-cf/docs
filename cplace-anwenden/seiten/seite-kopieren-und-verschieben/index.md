# Copying and moving a page

You can copy and move pages within a tenant.

## Copying a page

To copy a page, proceed as follows:

::: {.note .note-prerequisite .with-title}
**Prerequisites**

You must have the "reader" permission for the page you would like to
copy. You must be the "editor" or the "administrator" in the target
space of the copy.
:::

1.  Open the page you would like to copy.

2.  In the page navigation bar, click the "More" button .

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The drop-down menu is opened.

3.  Click the **Copy** option.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The "Choose Target Type" dialog is
    displayed. Depending on the page type, the "Select target" dialog
    may be displayed immediately. In this case, jump directly to step 6.

4.  Select whether the page is to be copied to a workspace or below a
    page.

::: {.note .note-hint .with-title}
**Display of a copied page in the workspace navigation**

Note that when you copy a page to a workspace the "Parent" attribute is
not automatically adapted. For this reason, the page is not displayed in
the workspace navigation menu after it has been copied. If you would
like to copy the page to a specific place in the page hierarchy (or to
another workspace), choose "Page" as the target type. If you would like
to copy a page of a type which does not have any hierarchy information
to another workspace, use the "workspace" target type.
:::

5.  Click the **\[Next\]** button.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The "Choose Target" dialog page is
    displayed.

6.  The current workspace or the parent page of the current page is
    preselected by default. Click the "Remove value" button to delete
    the pre-selection and to select another page or another workspace.
    The target selection (workspace/page) depends on the target type you
    selected previously. If you have selected "workspace" as the target
    type, only workspaces in which the type of the opened page is
    available are displayed.

7.  Click the **\[Next\]** button.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The "Edit copied attributes" dialog is
    displayed.

8.  If required, edit the attributes of the copied page. The editable
    attributes depend on the type configuration.

9.  Click the **\[Next\]** button.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} A batch job is created and run for the
    copying process. If the batch job has been successful, the message
    "Cloning successfully finished" is displayed.

10. Click the **\[OK\]** button to close the dialog. Alternatively, you
    can jump directly to the copy of the page using the link which is
    displayed after the copying has been successfully completed.

[]{.fas .fa-check-square} The "Copy page" dialog is closed.

## Moving a page

To move a page, proceed as follows:

::: {.note .note-prerequisite .with-title}
**Prerequisites**

You must have the "editor" permission for the page to be moved. You must
be the "editor" or the "administrator" in the target space.
:::

1.  Open the page you would like to move.

2.  In the page navigation bar, click the "More" button .

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The drop-down menu is opened.

3.  Click the **Move** option.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The "Choose Target Type" dialog is
    displayed. Depending on the page type, the "Choose Target" dialog
    may be displayed immediately. In this case, go directly to step 6.

4.  Select whether the page is to be moved to a workspace or below a
    page.

    ::: {.note .note-hint .with-title}
    **Display of a moved page in the workspace navigation**

    Note that when you move a page to a workspace the parent page is not
    automatically adapted and the page is therefore not displayed in the
    workspace navigation menu. If you would like to move the page to a
    specific place in the page hierarchy (or to another workspace),
    choose "Page" as the target type. If you would like to move a page
    of a type which does not have any hierarchy information to another
    workspace, use the "(Work-)Space" target type.
    :::

5.  Click the **\[Next\]** button.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The second "Move" dialog page for
    selecting the target of the moving operation is displayed.

6.  Depending on the target type, choose either a target space or a
    target parent page. Only target spaces in which the type of the
    opened page is available are displayed.

7.  Click the **\[Next\]** button to execute the move.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The page is moved and opened in the new
    workspace.
