# Page Settings

You can manage the permissions and the attributes of the page in the
page settings. You can also view and manage the files attached to the
page in the page settings. The incoming references and links are also
displayed.

## Displaying page settings

To display the settings of a page, proceed as follows:

1.  In the page navigation bar, click **Page Settings** to display the
    available tabs.

2.  Click the **Properties** tab.

[]{.fas .fa-check-square} The properties of the page are displayed.

## Page designations

Here you can adjust the name of the page. To do this, proceed as
follows:

1.  Hover your mouse pointer over the **Name** field.

[]{.fas .fa-check-square} The icon is displayed in the field.

2.  Click to change the name.

3.  Enter the desired name for the page and then click **\[Save\]**.

[]{.fas .fa-check-square} The name of the page has been adjusted.

## Permissions

The three roles and the current members of the roles for this page are
displayed in the permissions:

- "Workspace administrators"
- "Editor"
- "Readers"

**Changing the permissions of a page**

The roles are derived from the workspace settings. The "editor" and
"reader" roles can be changed on a page-specific basis, however. To
change the "editors" or "readers" of a page, proceed as follows:

::: {.note .note-prerequisite .with-title}
**Prerequisite**

You must have the "editor" role for the page to change its "editors" and
"readers". "Administrators" of a workspace are automatically "editors"
of all pages in this workspace.
:::

1.  Click the **\[Edit all\]** button.

[]{.fas .fa-check-square} The roles are opened in editing mode.

You can decide whether you want to add a further user/group to the
editors/readers derived from the workspace or whether you want to
completely override the permissions. Click the button to switch between
"Inherit and add" and "Override with".

2.  Click the selection dialog and from the list select the user to whom
    you want to grant the permission for this page.

3.  Click the **\[Save\]** button.

[]{.fas .fa-check-square} The changes have been saved.

You can find more information on permissions in the section [Managing
permissions](/user-manual-en/cplace-administrieren/berechtigungen-verwalten/).

## Type and subpages

The "Type" field shows the type of the current page.

**Changing the page type**

::: {.note .note-prerequisite .with-title}
**Prerequisite**

You must be a workspace administrator to be able to change the type of a
page.
:::

To change the type of a page, proceed as follows:

1.  Hover the mouse pointer over the **Type** field.

[]{.fas .fa-check-square} The icon is displayed in the type field.

2.  Click to change the type.

3.  In the selection list choose the required new type.

4.  Click the **\[Save\]** button.

    ::: {.note .note-hint .with-title}
    **Note new attributes after type change**

    The new type usually has other (mandatory) attributes which may need
    to be filled out after the type has been changed. You will only see
    the attributes of the new type after the page has been refreshed.
    :::

**Subpages**

The subpages of the current page are displayed in this field. You can
change the (display) order of the subpages using drag and drop.

the Files tab. You can also upload new files here. A detailed
description of how to manage files can be found under ["Managing
files".](/user-manual-en/cplace-anwenden/dateien-verwalten/)

## Comments

In the Comments tab, you can see all the comments which already exist on
this page. You can also add further comments here. The comments can also
be displayed or entered in the (page) view using the "Comments" widget.

## Incoming references

The incoming references are sorted by types and all pages which have a
link to the current page by way of a reference attribute are displayed
in a table.

## Incoming links

Pages which have set a link to this page in a text widget are displayed
in incoming links.

## Expert Settings

You will find the counter for generating names in the Expert Settings.
All types have such a counter which is incremented by one digit with
every new page of this type. The counter displayed here shows the
counter reading of the current page. The counter is set to -1 by default
which means that an automatically generated counter reading based on the
counter of the type is used.

1.  Click the **\[Edit all\]** button to edit the counter for generating
    names.
