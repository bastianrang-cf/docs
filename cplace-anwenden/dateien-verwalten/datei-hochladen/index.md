# Uploading a file

You can upload files in cplace to save them in a central location. You
can continue to use uploaded files in cplace, for example, by using
uploaded web graphics (PNG, JPEG, GIF) in wiki widgets or by setting
hyperlinks to uploaded files. Files are always uploaded on one page,
either in the **Files** widget in the page view (depending on the
configured page layout) or in the page settings, where the **Files**
widget is permanently integrated.

**Prerequisite**

You must be the "editor" of the page to be able to upload files to this
page.
