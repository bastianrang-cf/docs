# Replacing a file with a new version

You have three options for uploading a new version of a file:

::: {.note .note-prerequisite .with-title}
**Prerequisite**

You must be the "editor" of the page on which the uploaded file is
located.
:::

## Uploading a new file version with the same name (on the same page)

The easiest way to upload a new version of a file is to upload it using
drag and drop. To do this, proceed as follows:

1.  Using drag and drop, drag a file to a "Files" widget in which there
    is already a file with the same name and the same file type.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} A new version of the existing file is
    automatically created.

## Uploading a new file version using a selection dialog

If your browser does not support drag and drop, you can upload a new
version of a file as follows:

1.  Open the page to which you would like to upload a file.

2.  Click the **\[Upload files\]** button.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The "Upload files" dialog is opened.

3.  Click one of the displayed **\[Choose file\]** buttons to select the
    file to be uploaded.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The file selection dialog is opened.

4.  Select the file to be uploaded, and click the **\[Open\]** button to
    copy the chosen file to the "Upload files" dialog.

    ::: {.note .note-hint .with-title}
    **New version of a file must have the same name and file extension**

    So that the uploaded file is added as a new version to an existing
    file, it must have the same name and the same file extension.
    :::

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The file name is now displayed in the
    "Upload files" dialog after the **\[Choose file\]** button.

    If you want to upload another file, click one of the other
    **\[Choose file\]** buttons.

5.  Click the **\[Upload files\]** button to upload the selected files.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The "Upload files" dialog is closed, and
    the uploaded files are displayed as new rows in the "Files" widget.

## Uploading a new file version using the File Details page

You can also upload a new file version using the details page of the
respective file. This is useful if you want to add a file with another
name as a new version of an existing file. To do this, proceed as
follows:

1.  Open the page on which the file to which you would like to add a new
    version is located.

2.  In the "Files" widget after the name of the file, click the
    "Details" button . You may have to refresh the page after it is
    first loaded by pressing **\[F5\]** so that the "Details" button is
    displayed.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The file detail page is opened.

3.  In the page navigation bar, click the "More" button .

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The drop-down menu is opened.

4.  In the menu, choose the **Upload new version** option.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} A dialog for selecting a new file is
    displayed.

5.  Click the **\[Upload file\]** button.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The file selection window is opened.

6.  Select the file that you would like to upload as the new version of
    the existing file. You can give the new file any name you wish and
    this name does not have to be the same as that of the existing file.

7.  In the selection dialog, click the **\[Open\]** button.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The selection dialog is closed. The
    selected file is displayed next to the **\[Choose file\]** button.

8.  Click the **\[Save\]** button to add the chosen file as a new
    version of the existing file.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The new version of the file is saved. You
    are forwarded to the File Details page.
