# Extracting a ZIP archive

If you have uploaded a ZIP archive to a page, you can extract this
directly in cplace. When the ZIP archive is extracted, another page with
the name of the ZIP archive is created underneath the current page. The
files of the ZIP archive are added as file attachments to these new
pages and can be seen in the "Files" widget. If the ZIP archive contains
one or more folders, an additional subpage is created for each folder
accordingly.
