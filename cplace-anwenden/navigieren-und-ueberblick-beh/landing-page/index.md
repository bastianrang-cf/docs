# Landing page

This page covers the basic structure of the landing page, for
information about the configuration go to the section ["Configuring the
landing
page".](/user-manual-en/cplace-konfigurieren/landing-page-konfigurieren/)

The landing page is the same as an adaptable homepage which maps
selected pages in a clearly arranged manner, thereby making navigation
easier. By configuring the start URL in the [application
settings](/user-manual-en/cplace-administrieren/applikationseinstellungen/),
a landing page can be made the start page for all users. All users can
also specify an individual landing page as the homepage using the home
URL in the profile.

If you have entered a landing page in the home URL in the application
settings, clicking the logo of your instance (left in the [top
navigation
bar](/user-manual-en/cplace-anwenden/navigieren-und-ueberblick-beh/hauptnavigation/))
will take you directly to the landing page, from where you can reach
selected pages by means of direct links. The contents available for this
are detailed below:
