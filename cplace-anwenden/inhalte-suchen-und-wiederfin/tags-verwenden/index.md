To display all pages with the same tag, proceed as follows:

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The detailed search is opened and all

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} A search field for tags and the 20 most
    common tags are displayed.

3.  Either click one of the displayed tags directly if the tag being
    searched for is already displayed there or enter the name of the
    searched for tag in the search field.

    ::: {.note .note-hint .with-title}
    **Enter the tag you are looking for in lower case**

    Tags are always saved in lower case letters. The search field for
    tags is a standard text field in which you can also enter upper case
    letters. If you are searching for a tag and are using upper case
    letters, the tag you want might not be found even if the order of
    letters matches exactly. For this reason, you should always enter
    the search text in the "Tag" field in lower case letters.
    :::

4.  After you have entered the tag name, click the Search button (this
    step does not apply if you are clicking a tag directly).

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} All the pages with the tag searched
    for/clicked on are displayed in the search hits.
