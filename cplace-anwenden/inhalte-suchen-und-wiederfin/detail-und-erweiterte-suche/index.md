# Detailed and advanced search {#detailed-and-advanced-search----eventuelle-änderungen-sind-auch-im-abschnitt-erste-schritte-vorzunehmen----}

In the detailed search, you can filter pages on the basis of workspaces,
types and attributes. You can also arrange certain filters so that they
refer to each other. On this page you will find out how to open a
detailed search and then further restrict the search hits by setting
filters.

Using advanced search, you can define complex searches consisting of
several inclusive and/or exclusive search queries.

## Opening the detailed search

First you must open the detailed search. To do this proceed as follows:

1.  Leave the search field empty and click in the header.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The search page is opened. In the
    left-hand section you will see the active and available search
    filters. In the right-hand section of the page the list of the
    search hits is displayed.

    ![image](../../../graphics/cplace-anwenden/Detailsuche-leer-de.png){loading="lazy"
    aria-label="Enlarged version of the current image"}
    :::

## Limiting search hits using filters

After you have opened the detailed search, you can limit the volume of
results bit by bit using different filters:

1.  Click in a filter criterion to open it.

    ::: md__image
    [](../../../graphics/cplace-anwenden/Detailsuche-Filterkriterium-erweitern-de.png)
    ![\"\"](../../../graphics/cplace-anwenden/Detailsuche-Filterkriterium-erweitern-de.png){loading="lazy"
    aria-label="Enlarged version of the current image"}
    :::

2.  Within a filter criterion, select one or more values, e.g.,
    restricting the search to a workspace, or define a relative search
    criterion (availability depending on the type of search criterion).

    ::: md__image
    [](../../../graphics/cplace-anwenden/Detailsuche-Filterkriterium-Auswahl-Wert-de.png)
    ![\"\"](../../../graphics/cplace-anwenden/Detailsuche-Filterkriterium-Auswahl-Wert-de.png){loading="lazy"
    aria-label="Enlarged version of the current image"}
    :::

    []{.fas .fa-check-square}The search hits are reduced based on the
    filters you have set.

:::: {.note .note-hint .with-title}
**Set filter explicitly by pressing the search button**

If you are using an attribute as a filter criterion or are editing an
existing filter, you must explicitly click within the filter criterion
to apply the new/changed filter criterion to the search hits.

## Opening advanced search

To switch from the detailed search to the advanced search mode, proceed
as follows:

1.  In detailed search, click the **"Switch to advanced search"** link.

    ::: md__image

    ![\"\"](../../../graphics/cplace-anwenden/Zur-erweiterten-Suche-wechseln-de.png){loading="lazy"
    aria-label="Enlarged version of the current image"}
    :::

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} Advanced search is opened.

## Define and run advanced search

In advanced search mode, you can configure and combine inclusive and
exclusive search filters. The hits from the inclusive queries are added
to the total search hits. The hits from exclusive queries reduce the
number of search hits. You can define several search filters for
inclusive and exclusive search queries.

To define an advanced search, proceed as follows:

1.  In advanced search mode, configure your search query, as in the
    simple detailed search, until the desired hits are displayed in the
    search hits from the search query (see also the section ["Limiting
    search hits using filters"](#limiting-search-hits-using-filters)).

2.  After configuring the search query, click the **\[ Add inclusive
    search query\]** button to add the configured search filter to the
    inclusive search queries.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The search filter is added to the
    inclusive search queries and the configuration of the search query
    is reset.

3.  You now have two options for expanding and reducing the total number
    of search hits:

  Add other inclusive search queries                                                                                                       Add excluding query
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  If you want to increase the number of search hits, repeat steps 1 and 2 to add further search queries to the inclusive search queries.   If you want to reduce the number of search hits, configure a search query where the hits are to be removed from the total number of search hits and then click the **\[ Add exclusive search query\]** button. Repeat this process to define several exclusive search queries (these are linked with OR).

[]{.fas .fa-check-square} The advanced search is configured and the
desired search hits are displayed.

## Editing added search filters in advanced search

If you have already added a search filter to the inclusive or exclusive
search queries, you can edit these as follows:

1.  In the list of inclusive or exclusive search queries, click the
    search filter to be edited.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The search filter is displayed in dark
    gray and the filter settings are displayed under "Limit selected
    search query".

2.  Edit the configuration of the search query.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The search hits are updated immediately
    upon each change. It is not necessary to add or save again.

::: {.note .note-info .with-title}
In the results list, you can display the results of the combined search
(all inclusive and exclusive queries) or just the current search query.
:::

## Deleting search filters from the inclusive or exclusive search queries of the advanced search

If you want to remove an existing search filter from the inclusive or
exclusive search queries of the advanced search, proceed as follows:

1.  Click the "Remove query" button of the search filter that you want
    to remove.

    :::

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The search filter is immediately removed
    from the relevant queries.
