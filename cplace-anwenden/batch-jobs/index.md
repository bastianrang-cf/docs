# Batch jobs

Batch jobs are automated tasks in which jobs are processed in a
predefined order without manual intervention. Batch jobs can be run
automatically at a specific time or according to a defined schedule. In
the user menu, you will find the menu option "Batch Jobs", which
redirects you to a page that provides an overview of your current and
completed batch jobs. If you belong to the default "Administrators"
group, you will see all batch jobs that have been started on the tenant.

Jobs" menu option.
