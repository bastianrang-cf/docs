# Forms Wizard

The cplace Forms Wizard offers the possibility to use No-Code to edit
your own display windows or to create step-by-step input forms and link
them to a wizard. In addition, you can dynamically control the dialog
process as well as data display and data processing with all the
possibilities offered by Low-Code scripts.

A configured wizard intercepts the usual creation dialog of defined
types and runs through the configured steps. Wizards can be activated
and disabled to either disable the usual creation dialog or to be able
to run it again. An incomplete wizard cannot be activated.

This section describes how to configure the wizard with No-Code.
Information on configuring the wizard with Low-Code can be found in the
[Low-Code
documentation.](https://docs.cplace.io/lowcode/features/forms-wizard/){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"}

Editor" when the step is reached.

### "Info" step type

The "Info" step type gives the user a text when the step is reached. The
text can either be defined in the "Step Editor" or created dynamically
via a script. Low-Code is required to use a script.

- Anonymous access must be allowed in the server configuration, see
  configuration option
  [cplace.security.general.enable-anonymous-access](https://docs.cplace.io/ops/configuration/reference/#cplace.security.general.enable-anonymous-access){target="_blank"
  rel="noopener"} in the Operations Manual.
:::

1.  Create a separate user who has access to all the data required for
    the wizard.

::: {.note .note-info .with-title}
**Separate, technical user for external access**

The technical user serves as a proxy for actual external users.
:::

2.  Enter the created user in the "External access user" field in the
    configuration of the wizard.
