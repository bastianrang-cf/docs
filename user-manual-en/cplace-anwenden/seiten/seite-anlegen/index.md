# Creating pages {#creating-pages----eventuelle-änderungen-sind-auch-im-abschnitt-erste-schritte-vorzunehmen----}

On this page, you will find out how to create a new page. Please note,
that pages in cplace are not exclusively text or wiki pages but are also
the instances of all other types that are represented via pages.
Accordingly, pages can be created in several ways.

A special case of page creation is the import, which is described in the
section ["Exporting and importing
pages".](/user-manual-en/cplace-anwenden/seiten/seite-exportieren-und-importieren/)

:::: {.note .note-tip .with-title}
**Quick creation of several pages of one type one after the other**

To create several pages of a type in quick succession, use the Create
and continue function. Using this function, the create dialog will
remain open after a page has been created and you will be able to create
the next page immediately.
