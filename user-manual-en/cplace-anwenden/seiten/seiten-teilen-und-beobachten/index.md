# Sharing and watching pages {#sharing-and-watching-pages----eventuelle-änderungen-sind-auch-im-abschnitt-erste-schritte-vorzunehmen----}

You can share a page with other users by sending the link to this page
by email. You can send a corresponding email by using the **Send link**
function, which you will find in the header of every page.

If user notifications are activated in the application settings, you can
additionally share pages with other users directly in cplace using the
**Notify users** function.

You also have the option of watching pages. You can track the pages you
have watched at a later stage really easily on the "Watched Activities"
page. If desired, you can also activate email notifications for all
watched activities and you will receive an email on a daily basis with a
summary of all changes made to the watched pages.
