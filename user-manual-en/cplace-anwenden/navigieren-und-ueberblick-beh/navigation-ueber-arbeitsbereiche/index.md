# Navigating across workspaces

## Workspace overview

The workspace overview is the first page to be displayed after you log
in. All workspaces to which you have access are displayed on the page.
From here you can open the various workspaces.

To find the desired workspace quickly, you can filter the displayed
workspace tiles using a separate full-text search.

You can also highlight workspaces as favorites so that these are
displayed in the upper section of the workspace overview.
