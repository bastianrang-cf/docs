# Watch activities {#watch-activities----eventuelle-änderungen-sind-auch-im-abschnitt-erste-schritte-vorzunehmen----}

You can use the **Watch** function to add pages or even entire
workspaces to your watched activities. In addition, you can activate
email notifications via the **Watched activities** item (user menu) to
be informed about changes to the watched elements (e.g., pages) by
email.

## Watching a page or workspace

To watch a page, proceed as follows:

1.  Open the page or the workspace which you would like to watch.

2.  In the page navigation bar, click the "More" button .

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The drop-down menu is opened.

3.  Click the **Watch** function (for pages) or, on the homepage of a
    workspace, **Watch workspace** (to watch an entire workspace).

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The page or the workspace is added to your
    "Watched activities".

## Displaying watched activities

To display the watched activities, proceed as follows:

1.  Open the "User Menu".

2.  In the user menu click the **Watched activities** option.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The "Watched Activities" page is
    displayed. On the left-hand side, you will see a timeline with the
    last changes made to the contents you have watched. On the
    right-hand side, you will see "Your watch list" which displays all
    the pages and workspaces you are watching.

## Activating email notifications for watched pages

In cplace, you have the option of being informed once a day by email
about which changes have been made within the last 24 hours to pages you
have watched.

Follow these steps to activate email notifications for watched
activities:

1.  Open the "User Menu".

2.  In the user menu click the **Watched activities** option.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The "Watched Activities" page is
    displayed.

3.  Click the **\[Activate email notifications\]** button to activate
    the email notifications for all your watched activities.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The "Email notifications" dialog is
    opened.

4.  Activate the checkbox "I would like to receive emails detailing all
    activity streams on the pages I have watched."

5.  Specify the maximum number of changes you are to be notified of by
    email. If the number of changes made in the last 24 hours exceeds
    the value specified here, this will be indicated to you in the
    email.

6.  Select whether changes you have made yourself are to be listed in
    the email. Activate the checkbox to exclude your own changes.

7.  Click the **\[Save\]** button to save the change.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The "Email notifications" dialog is
    closed. The email notifications for the watched activity streams are
    now activated.

## Stop watching

To stop watching a page, proceed as follows:

1.  Open the "User Menu".

2.  In the user menu click the **Watched activities** option.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The "Watched Activities" page is
    displayed.

3.  In "Your watch list" click the next to the page/workspace which you
    would like to stop watching.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The page/workspace is removed from the
    watch list and is thus no longer a part of the "Watched activities."
