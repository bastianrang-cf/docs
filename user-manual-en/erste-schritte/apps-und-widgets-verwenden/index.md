# Using apps and widgets

## Apps {#apps----eventuelle-änderungen-sind-auch-im-abschnitt-cplace-konfigurierenapps-vorzunehmen----}

In cplace, you can use various apps to add additional functions and
widgets to the platform. Apps are installed per workspace so that you
can control in which workspaces certain data types, functions, and
widgets are available. Apps are added and managed in the respective
workspace settings.

## Adding an app

To add an app to a workspace, proceed as follows:

::: {.note .note-prerequisite .with-title}
**Prerequisite**

You must be an "administrator" of the respective workspace to open the
workspace settings and add apps.
:::

1.  Open the workspace to which you would like to add apps.

2.  Click **Workspace settings** in the workspace navigation and click
    the **Apps** menu item in the context menu that appears.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The apps overview page with all installed
    and available apps is displayed.

3.  Click the **\[Install\]** button beside the desired app to add the
    respective app to the current workspace.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The app is added to the workspace and
    displayed under "Installed apps".

You can find out more about "Apps in cplace" in the section
["Apps".](/user-manual-en/cplace-konfigurieren/apps/)

## Widgets {#widgets----eventuelle-änderungen-sind-auch-im-abschnitt-cplace-konfigurierenseiten-widgets-konfigurieren-vorzunehmen----}

Widgets are the components of a page with which content in cplace can be
displayed in a certain form. Which widgets are displayed on a page is
defined in the layout settings of the page. Most widgets have a
customizable configuration that can be edited directly in the widget or
via the layout settings. So that the widget positions and configuration
does not have to be done individually for each page, you have the option
of defining a fixed layout for all pages of a type. To carry out the
layout configuration of an entire (page) type, you use the type
configuration in the workspace settings.

::: {.note .note-hint .with-title}
**Editors can only edit layouts of individual pages**

As the "editor" in a workspace, you can edit the layout and therefore
the widget configuration of individual pages. To be able to edit the
layout of an entire (page) type, you must have the "Administrator"
permission in the workspace.
:::

## Adding a widget to a page

To add a widget in the layout of a single page, proceed as follows:

::: {.note .note-prerequisite .with-title}
**Prerequisite**

You must have "editor" permission on the page or you must be the
"administrator" of the workspace. To add a widget to a type layout, you
must have the "Administrator" or "Layout Editor" workspace permission.
:::

1.  Open the page to which you would like to add a widget.

2.  In the page navigation bar, click **Page Settings** to display the
    available tabs.

3.  Click the **Layout** tab.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The layout preview for this page is
    displayed.

4.  Click the "Add new widget" button in the desired layout column. If
    necessary, adjust the column layout and the widget positions using
    drag and drop as required.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The dialog for selecting widgets is
    displayed.

5.  In the widget selection, click the name or the tile of the required
    widget to add it to the chosen layout column.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The widget is added and opened in
    configuration mode.

6.  Configure the widget as needed.

7.  Click the **\[Save\]** button to save the configuration of the
    widget.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The widget configuration is saved and the
    (layout) preview is displayed.

8.  In the page navigation bar, click the "Return to the content of the
    page" button to go back to the page view.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The page view is opened. The widget is
    displayed at the position you have chosen and displays the content
    in accordance with the configuration you made previously.
