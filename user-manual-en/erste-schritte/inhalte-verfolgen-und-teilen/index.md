# Tracking and sharing content

In cplace there are various options for tracking content and sharing it
with others. Two key functions are **sending links** and **watching**
(activities).

## Sending a link {#sending-a-link----eventuelle-änderungen-sind-auch-im-abschnitt-cplace-anwendenseitenseiten-teilen-und-beobachten-vorzunehmen----}

To send the link to a page to one or more users, proceed as follows:

1.  Open the page you would like to share with others.

2.  In the page navigation bar, click the "More" button .

3.  Choose the **Send link** option.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The "Send Link Via Email" dialog is
    opened.

4.  In the "Recipients" field, select the users to whom you would like
    to send the link. You can also select a group.

5.  If necessary, adjust the text of the email to be sent. Be careful
    not to change or delete the link to the page contained in the email,
    as otherwise there will be no reference to the page in the email.

6.  Click the **\[Send Link\]** button to send the email with the link
    to the page.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The dialog is closed and the email is
    sent.

## Watching activities {#watching-activities----eventuelle-änderungen-sind-auch-im-abschnitt-cplace-anwendennavigieren-und-uebersicht-behaltenaktivitäten-beobachten-vorzunehmen----}

You can use the **Watch** function to add pages or even entire
workspaces to your watched activities. In addition, you can activate
email notifications via the **Watched activities** item (in the [User
menu](/user-manual-en/cplace-anwenden/benutzereinstellungen-aendern/benutzermenue/))
to be informed once a day by email about changes to the watched
elements.

To watch a page, proceed as follows:

1.  Open the page or the workspace which you would like to watch.

2.  In the page navigation bar, click the "More" button .

3.  Click the **Watch** function (for pages) or, on the homepage of a
    workspace, **Watch workspace** (to watch an entire workspace).

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The page or the workspace is added to your
    "Watched activities".

You can find information on displaying all watched activities and on
activating the email notifications for the watched activities in the
section page ["Watching
activities".](/user-manual-en/cplace-anwenden/navigieren-und-ueberblick-beh/aktivitaeten-beobachten/)
