# Working with pages {#working-with-pages----eventuelle-änderungen-sind-auch-im-abschnitt-cplace-anwendenseiten-vorzunehmen----}

All content in cplace is displayed on pages. At their most basic, these
are simple text pages that contain a wiki widget and a comments widget.
However objects of all other types are pages as well, for example
schedules, tasks, etc.

Every type has attributes. You will find these attributes on every page
of the respective type. Pages therefore form the container for the
attributes but are also used at the same time to display the attributes
and to provide cross-page information. Further information on the page
concept can be found in the section
["Pages".](/user-manual-en/cplace-anwenden/seiten/)

Pages can contain structured and unstructured content such as:

- Document libraries; wiki libraries
- Files
- Wikis
- Tables with type and attribute definitions
- Comments
- Visualizations

Each page can contain subpages that can be nested in a hierarchy.

More details on working with pages can be found in the section
["Pages".](/user-manual-en/cplace-anwenden/seiten/)
