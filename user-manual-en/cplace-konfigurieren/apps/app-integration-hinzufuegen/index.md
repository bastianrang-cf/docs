# Adding an app integration

You can integrate some apps with other apps. As a result of the
integration, links between types of apps are created, for example. The
links between the types are sometimes also visualized in widgets which
supply the apps.

Which integrations are available depends on which other apps are
activated on the server and which integrations have been created by the
developers of the respective app.

An integration with another app is not added automatically but must be
added manually in each case.

To add an integration to an app, proceed as follows:

::: {.note .note-prerequisite .with-title}
**Prerequisite**

You must be the "administrator" in the workspace to be able to add an
app integration.
:::

1.  Open the workspace to which you would like to add the app
    integration.

2.  Click **Workspace settings** in the workspace navigation and click
    the **Apps** menu item in the context menu that appears.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} An overview of the apps installed in this
    workspace and the available apps is displayed.

3.  In the "Installed Apps" section, search for the app to which you
    would like to add an integration.

4.  Move the mouse pointer over the app tile and click the **\[Learn
    more\]** button that now appears.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The details view of the app is displayed.

5.  Click **Integrations** to display the available integrations.

6.  Click the slider beside the relevant integration to add it.

    ::: {.note .note-info .with-title}
    **Automatic installation of dependencies**

    If the integration contains a link to an app which has not yet been
    installed in the workspace, this app is added together with the
    integration.
    :::

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The app integration is added. Apps which
    may not have yet been installed and which are part of the
    integration are added to the workspace.
