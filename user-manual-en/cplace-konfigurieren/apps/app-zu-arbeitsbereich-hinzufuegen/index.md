# Adding an app to a workspace {#adding-an-app-to-a-workspace----eventuelle-änderungen-sind-auch-im-abschnitt-erste-schritte-vorzunehmen----}

To add an app to a workspace, proceed as follows:

::: {.note .note-prerequisite .with-title}
**Prerequisite**

You must be the "administrator" in the workspace to which you want to
add an app.
:::

1.  Open the workspace to which you would like to add the app.

2.  Click **Workspace settings** in the workspace navigation and click
    the **Apps** menu item in the context menu that appears.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} An overview of the apps installed in this
    workspace and the available apps is displayed.

3.  In the section "Available Apps" search for the app that you would
    like to add to the workspace.

4.  Click the **\[Install\]** button beside the app you want to add to
    the workspace.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The app is added. Depending on the content
    and configuration of the app, new pages are added to and new type
    definition pages are displayed in the workspace navigation menu.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The added app is displayed in the
    installed apps.

::: {.note .note-info .with-title}
**Dependencies to other apps**

The description of the app includes which dependencies there are with
other apps and which apps it can be integrated with. If there are
dependencies with other apps, the dependent apps are also added when the
selected app is added. By contrast, integrations to other apps must be
added manually.
