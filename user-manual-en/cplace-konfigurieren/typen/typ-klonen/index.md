# Cloning a type

To clone a type, proceed as follows:

::: {.note .note-prerequisite .with-title}
**Prerequisite**

You must be the "administrator" of the workspace.
:::

1.  Open the workspace in which the type that you would like to clone is
    defined.

2.  Click **Workspace settings** in the workspace navigation menu and
    then click the menu item **Types** in the context menu that is now
    displayed.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The table with the types of this workspace
    is displayed.

3.  In the table search for the type that you would like to clone.

4.  Click the name of the type.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The type definition page is opened. All
    the pages of this type are displayed in a table.

5.  In the page navigation bar, click the "More" button .

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The drop-down menu is opened.

6.  Click the **Clone** option in the menu.

    []{.fas .fa-check-square} The "Clone type" dialog is displayed.

7.  Select the (target) space in which the clone of the current type is
    to be created.

8.  Enter an internal name for the clone.

    ::: {.note .note-hint .with-title}
    **Set new internal name depending on further use**

    Specify the exact same internal name that you used for the original
    type so that you only have to select one type at a later stage when
    searching to find pages from both workspaces. If you want to use the
    clone as an independent type and if you would like to search
    separately for it for example, choose a new internal name.\
    A new internal name is also necessary if you are cloning the type
    within the same workspace.
    :::

9.  Click the **\[Clone\]** button to run the cloning of the type.

[]{.fas .fa-check-square} The cloning task is started in a separate
batch job.

10. After the batch job has been successfully run, click the **\[OK\]**
    button.

[]{.fas .fa-check-square} The type overview of the target workspace is
opened.
