# Delete Workspace

To delete a workspace, proceed as follows:

::: {.note .note-prerequisite .with-title}
**Prerequisite**

- You must be the "administrator" of the workspace or a member of the
  default "Administrators" group.
:::

::: {.note .note-info .with-title}
**Workspace must not be connected to a package installation**

You cannot delete a workspace if it is connected to a package
installation. You can find out how to disconnect a workspace from a
package in the "cplace Solution Playbook" documentation in the section
["Disconnecting a Package from a
Workspace".](https://docs.cplace.io/app-dev/solution-management/solution-management-ui-instructions/installation_operation_instructions/#disconnecting-a-package-from-a-workspace){target="_blank"

1.  Open the workspace you would like to delete.

2.  Click **Workspace settings** in the workspace navigation menu and
    then click the name of any tab of the workspace settings in the
    context menu that is now displayed.

[]{.fas .fa-check-square} The selected tab of the workspace settings is
opened.

3.  In the page navigation bar, click the "More" button .

[]{.fas .fa-check-square} The drop-down menu is opened.

4.  Click the **Delete** menu item.

[]{.fas .fa-check-square} The "Delete workspace" dialog is displayed.

::: {.note .note-warn .with-title}
**Simple restoration of an entire workspace is not possible!**

When you delete the workspace, all the pages and types as well as the
hierarchical relationships within the workspace are deleted.\
A deleted workspace cannot be restored in its entirety using the
"Deleted contents" page.\
You can only restore the elements of the workspace (types, pages, etc.)
individually in each case. You need to pay attention to the order
however.
:::

*Optional*: Activate the "Remove workspace permanently?" checkbox to
delete the workspace permanently. The workspace and its pages are not
displayed on the "Deleted Items" page. You can no longer restore the
workspace.

5.  In the confirmation field, enter the word "DELETE".

6.  Click the **\[Delete\]** button to confirm the deletion of the
    workspace.

[]{.fas .fa-check-square} The workspace is deleted.
