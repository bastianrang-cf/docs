## Overview of group settings

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Setting                             Description
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  **Short description**               An optional description of the
                                      group.

  **Registration to group**           cplace supports several options for
                                      how users become members of a
                                      group. For each group, you can
                                      specify whether\
                                      - only administrators can add new
                                      members to the group,\
                                      - users can apply for membership of
                                      the group themselves, but must be
                                      approved by a group administrator
                                      or\
                                      - users can join a group
                                      independently without approval by a
                                      group administrator.

  **Open Applications for             The system displays here how many
  Membership**                        applications for membership in the
                                      group are still open. The value is
                                      calculated automatically and
                                      therefore cannot be edited.

  **Email notifications**             All group members entered here
                                      receive an email when\
                                      - a new member registers in the
                                      group,\
                                      - a user applies for membership,\
                                      - a user is added to the group or\
                                      - a user is removed from the group.

  **Administrators**                  Every group has its own
                                      administrators. These people do not
                                      have to be global administrators.
                                      Administrators of a group can
                                      always add new users to the group.
                                      By default, you are the group's
                                      administrator. You can however also
                                      add further administrators.

  **Memberships are visible for**     This setting controls who can see
                                      the members of a group. Possible
                                      options are the *Members of the
                                      group*, *Logged-in users* and
                                      *Everybody* (in other words also
                                      users who do not have a user
                                      account if anonymous access to the
                                      tenant has been granted).

  **Allow sending emails to all group When this option is activated, the
  members**                           members of the group can send an
                                      email to all members of the group
                                      via cplace. If necessary, this
                                      option should be deactivated if
                                      very large groups are involved to
                                      prevent unwanted spam messages from
                                      group members.
