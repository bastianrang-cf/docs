# Activate or deactivate group members

Users in groups can have the status "Active" or "Applies for". For users
to be considered members of a group, the status of the respective users
within the group must be "Active". Although users with the status
"Applies for" are visible in the group member overview, they are not
considered group members. Users with the status "Applies for" have
either not yet been approved by a group administrator, the status has
been changed manually from "Active" to "Applies for" or the group
membership has expired. You can ["Change the status of individual group
members"](#activate-or-deactivate-individual-group-members) or activate
all group members with the status "Applies for" using the ["Activate all
inactive members"](#activate-all-group-members) function.
