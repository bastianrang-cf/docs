+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Run an Admin Script**           | Using this function, you can run  |
|                                   | Admin Scripts (Java classes) for  |
|                                   | the runtime and through the user  |
|                                   | interface. In order to display    |
|                                   | this function, a                  |
|                                   | `admin-scripts-token.txt` file    |
|                                   | must have been saved in the       |
|                                   | 'properties' directory in the     |
|                                   | installation path. The file may   |
|                                   | contain only the token, a random  |
|                                   | number and letter value. The      |
|                                   | token is requested when the admin |
|                                   | script is entered and before it   |
|                                   | is sent, and the execution of     |
|                                   | Java code is thus limited only to |
|                                   | users who know the token.         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Set system message**            | You can set a system-wide message |
|                                   | here that is shown on all pages.\ |
