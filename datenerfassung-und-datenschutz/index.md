# Data Collection and Data Privacy {#data-collection-and-data-privacy .mb-3 .mt-4}

## Data collection for a better user experience

To continuously provide you with innovations that make your workday more
efficient, we use anonymized usage analytics that comply with the
highest GDPR standards. This data-driven approach allows us to make
informed product decisions.

## Uncompromising security for sensitive business data

The protection of your business data is our top priority. The entire
data collection follows a strict security concept:

- **Complete Anonymization:** User IDs are always processed anonymously.
- **No transmission of sensitive data:** URLs, project names, texts,
  images, and all customer data are generally not transmitted.
- **Strict Limitation:** Only UI interactions such as clicks on
  functional elements are recorded.

Even with highly sensitive projects that are subject to strict security
regulations, your data remains fully protected. The data collection does
not provide us with any insights into content, but rather only about the
usage intensity of features. Our data collection practices have been
validated by data protection experts, meet the strict requirements of
works councils and comply with the highest information security
standards.

## Concrete benefits of use

The analytical recording of UI interactions enables us to gain precise
insights into the frequency of use and relevance of cplace functions.
For example, we can identify which table functions are particularly
valuable to users without ever knowing who uses these functions or what
content is being processed. When data collection is enabled, you also
benefit from:

- Context-sensitive in-app guides for more efficient onboarding
- Targeted support for new functionalities
- An annual customer satisfaction survey for continuous product
  improvement

## Full control

Data collection can be deactivated at user level at any time. For more
information on configuration, see the section [Enabling/disabling
third-party
apps.](../cplace-anwenden/benutzereinstellungen-aendern/drittanbieter-apps-aktivieren-deaktivieren/)
